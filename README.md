press H key on canvas to show help.

fun canvas grid with some simple stuff. wasd and arrow keys move the pixel, clicking adds a ball object, and everything has a fade effect, also the grid gets rezised with the browser window but once it grew to a certain point it doesn't get smaller(nvm, fixed =D ), yeah... this is part of my practices learning programming using javascript. enjoy =D
